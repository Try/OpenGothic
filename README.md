### OpenGothic
Open source remake of Gothic 2: Night of the raven.
Motivation: Original Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 is still great games to play, but it not easy to make them work on modern systems.
The goal of this project is to make feature complete Gothic client-app compatible with game itself and regular mods for it.

##### Mods compatibility
Mods delivered as *.mod files shoud work, since *.mod contains visual content and scripts.  
Don't expect mods created with AST-SDK to work, since original Gothic and OpenGothic are not binary compatible.  
Don't expect DirectX11 mod to work, since technicaly it's not a mod. But Project is aiming to have a good graphics with shaders out of box.
