### Project structure

### Tracking of progress and bug reporting
Those guidlined are not strict, just a recomandations rather.  
This project uses wiki to track not implemented features and issues to track bugs:

* Features:  
  [Detailed list of features](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic/wiki/Feature-list)  
  You can create a issue, if you want to work on a feature and want to notify everyone.
  
* Script-api:  
  [Detailed list of implemented api functions](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic/wiki/Daedalus-scripts)
  
* Bugs in already implemented stuff:  
  This is a good case for issue
  
* Bugs in partially implemented feature:  
  You can submit a issue, if this bug causes crash, or makes game unplayable somehow.
  
* Renderer:  
  At this moment I'm looking forward to rewrite it - not much need in issues here
